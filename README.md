 Text-classification-using-ML-algorithms:
 Text Classification with ML algorithms : MLP, LogisticRegression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest.In this code the dataset from kaggle was used.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) #The dataset is contain a number of cases that come to hospital and based on their situation they sent to different sections #So we used preprocessing method we get rid off unnecessary data #and then our data frame woeld be based on two parameters symptoms of the sick people person and sections #So we trained some with some ML algorithms : MLP, LogisticRegression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, And find their accuracy in prediction</p> </li>
